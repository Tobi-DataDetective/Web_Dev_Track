Most important principles in building RESTful API are:
- Use HTTP Request verbs
- Use specific pattern of routes/endpoint URLs

HTTP verbs:
GET    POST   PUT  PATCH   DELETE

GET = READ

POST = CREATE

PUT PATCH == UPDATE

DELETE = DELECT

PUT IS SIMPLY REPLACING THE THE BICYCLE WITH A NEW ONE, WHILE PATCH IS REPLACING THE SPOILT TYRE RATHER THAN THE WHOLE BICYCLE
